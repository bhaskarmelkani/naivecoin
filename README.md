# Naivechain - a blockchain implementation
A modified fork of [lhartikk/naivechain](https://github.com/lhartikk/naivechain). This project is still in developement.

### Motivation
All the current implementations of blockchains are tightly coupled with the larger context and problems they (e.g. Bitcoin or Ethereum) are trying to solve. This makes understanding blockchains a necessarily harder task, than it must be. Especially source-code-wisely. This project is an attempt to provide as concise and simple implementation of a blockchain as possible.

 
### What is blockchain
[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain_(database)) : Blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously-growing list of records called blocks secured from tampering and revision.

### Key concepts of Naivechain
Check also [this blog post](https://medium.com/@lhartikk/a-blockchain-in-200-lines-of-code-963cc1cc0e54#.dttbm9afr5) for a more detailed overview of the key concepts
* HTTP interface to control the node
* Use Websockets to communicate with other nodes (P2P)
* Super simple "protocols" in P2P communication
* Data is not persisted in nodes
* No proof-of-work or proof-of-stake: a block can be added to the blockchain without competition

### Quick start
(set up two connected nodes and mine 1 block)
```
npm install
HTTP_PORT=3001 P2P_PORT=6001 npm start
HTTP_PORT=3002 P2P_PORT=6002 PEERS=ws://localhost:6001 npm start
curl -H "Content-type:application/json" --data '{"data" : "Some data to the first block"}' http://localhost:3001/mineBlock
```

```
npm install
npm start
```

##### Get blockchain
```
curl http://localhost:3001/blocks
```

##### Mine a block
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/mineBlock
``` 

##### Send transaction
```
curl -H "Content-type: application/json" --data '{"address": "04bfcab8722991ae774db48f934ca79cfb7dd991229153b9f732ba5334aafcd8e7266e47076996b55a14bf9913ee3145ce0cfc1372ada8ada74bd287450313534b", "amount" : 35}' http://localhost:3001/sendTransaction
```

##### Query transaction pool
```
curl http://localhost:3001/transactionPool
```

##### Mine transaction
```
curl -H "Content-type: application/json" --data '{"address": "04bfcab8722991ae774db48f934ca79cfb7dd991229153b9f732ba5334aafcd8e7266e47076996b55a14bf9913ee3145ce0cfc1372ada8ada74bd287450313534b", "amount" : 35}' http://localhost:3001/mineTransaction
```

##### Get balance
```
curl http://localhost:3001/balance
```

#### Query information about a specific address
```
curl http://localhost:3001/address/04f72a4541275aeb4344a8b049bfe2734b49fe25c08d56918f033507b96a61f9e3c330c4fcd46d0854a712dc878b9c280abe90c788c47497e06df78b25bf60ae64
```

##### Add peer
```
curl -H "Content-type:application/json" --data '{"peer" : "ws://localhost:6001"}' http://localhost:3001/addPeer
```
#### Query connected peers
```
curl http://localhost:3001/peers
```
